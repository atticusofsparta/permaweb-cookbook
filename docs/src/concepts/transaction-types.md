# Transaction Types

Arweave supports different types of transactions that serve various purposes in the permaweb ecosystem. Understanding these transaction types is essential for working effectively with Arweave.

## Overview

While all data on Arweave is stored as transactions, there are specialized transaction formats designed for specific use cases. These specialized formats help organize data, improve efficiency, and enable complex applications on the permaweb.

## Types of Transactions

### Transaction Bundles

[Transaction bundles](./bundles.md) are special transactions that can contain multiple other transactions or data items bundled together. Bundles are crucial for Arweave's scalability, allowing thousands of transactions per second by combining many transactions into a single bundle.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improved scalability and throughput
- Guaranteed transaction posting reliability
- Support for nested bundles
- Enhanced availability of data

### Path Manifests

[Path manifests](./manifests.md) provide a way to organize multiple transactions under a single base transaction ID with human-readable file paths. They are essential for creating practical applications and websites on Arweave.

**Key Benefits:**
- Organize related files together
- Enable human-readable file paths
- Support for hosting websites and applications
- Simplify NFT collection management

## When to Use Each Type

**Use Transaction Bundles when:**
- Uploading multiple files or data items
- Requiring guaranteed transaction posting
- Building high-throughput applications
- Needing immediate data availability

**Use Path Manifests when:**
- Creating websites or web applications
- Organizing file collections (like NFT metadata)
- Providing user-friendly file access
- Building hierarchical data structures

## Getting Started
To learn more about each transaction type, explore the detailed guides:

- [Transaction Bundles](./bundles.md) - Learn about bundling multiple transactions
- [Path Manifests](./manifests.md) - Understand how to organize files with paths

Both transaction types are fundamental building blocks for creating sophisticated applications on the permaweb.
